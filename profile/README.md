# InfraVillage

**The platform for infrastructure intelligence.**

⚠️ **Status**: Currently in development.

---

## What We're Building

InfraVillage is the ecosystem platform behind **DraftMyStack**, our flagship cloud cost modeling tool.

We're building infrastructure intelligence tools that help professionals make better architectural and cost decisions.

**DraftMyStack is our first product.** The broader InfraVillage platform will support additional infrastructure decision-making capabilities as the ecosystem matures.

---

## Platform Vision

InfraVillage exists to solve a simple problem: **infrastructure knowledge is fragmented**.

Cost modeling tools lack template libraries. Infrastructure patterns are scattered across blogs, GitHub repos, and StackOverflow. There's no clear path to monetize infrastructure expertise beyond consulting.

**We believe:**
- Infrastructure patterns should be shareable and discoverable
- Template creators deserve to monetize their expertise
- Cost awareness should be built into architectural decisions
- Community knowledge should be accessible, not scattered

InfraVillage will eventually provide a space for battle-tested templates, cost-aware patterns, and community-driven infrastructure knowledge.

**But not yet.** Platforms are earned, not launched.

## Current Status

⚠️ **In development.** DraftMyStack comes first.

We're focused on proving the core value proposition through DraftMyStack before expanding the platform.

InfraVillage will grow **only when DraftMyStack depends on it** — not before.

## About This GitHub

InfraVillage's core products are proprietary.

This GitHub organization is used for:
- **Public labs & experiments** (e.g., TAGtastic)
- **Open infrastructure utilities**
- **Marketplace templates** (coming later)
- **Community discussions** around infra design & cost

## Share Your Insights

We're building InfraVillage based on real infrastructure challenges faced by professionals like you.

**If you've:**
- Built infrastructure patterns you wish you could share or monetize
- Struggled to find battle-tested, cost-optimized templates
- Debated architecture decisions with incomplete cost data
- Rebuilt common patterns (3-tier apps, microservices, data pipelines) repeatedly

**Open a GitHub Discussion** and share your experience.

We're looking for **real stories about infrastructure knowledge gaps**, not feature wishlists.

Your insights will shape how InfraVillage supports template sharing, cost awareness, and community knowledge.

## InfraVillage Labs

InfraVillage Labs hosts small, standalone tools and utilities built in public.

These projects:
- Are general-purpose
- Are not part of any core product
- Do not expose proprietary systems
- May or may not be used internally

Labs projects are complete, intentional tools — not previews or teasers.
